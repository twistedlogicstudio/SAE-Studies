## Why Github?
Fistly I take all of my notes in either Obsidian or Logseq, or more importantly in Markdown.
This is done for:
1. A localised format for my notes.
  - Where I'm not (completely) subject to the cloud  
2. Markdown notes are saved as Plain Text
  - If a platform for note taking suddenly becomes redundant, I still have complete access to everything I've written down
  - This also has the ability to easily (more or less) transfer to another app or platform that supports Markdown Syntax

Now that we understand the main reason why I use Markdown, we can bounce off that and look at why Github is the next logical step.
I'm becoming a big advocate for open-source software, and with that a more begrudging outlook on paying a company for things like cross-platform syncing.
I, in the end want to be the one in control of my work, and the way it's backed up (Google Drive has burnt me one too many times).

### So with that I have a couple of points in need of a solution:
1. An easy and simple way to backup my plain text notes online
2. Have that online backup accessable anywhere
3. Have the notes easily readable online - including embedded images / videos / etc.
4. Have an easy way of sharing notes to others / collaborators

## What's Included
With the secondary goal of this being an easy way to collate all of my notes / work into one place & sharing it with facilitators / peer, it should be stated that: 

***Please Read the LICENSE (to be written lol) in regards to using any of my creative work outside of SAE or student / teaching purposes***
